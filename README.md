Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a form of dialysis that operates continuously (i.e. blood is constantly passing through the dialysis filter). It is suitable for patients who are critically unwell in the ICU as the rate of fluid and solute removal can be accurately controlled, and done gradually to prevent large changes in patient state. 

One major complication of CRRT is filter clotting, which is undesirable as the whole dialysis circuit needs to be reprimed (i.e. patient is disconnected from dialysis), patient blood in the circuit is lost (because it is clotted and cannot be returned to the patient), and additional cost is incurred (the filter is very expensive).

Anticoagulation (blood thinning) medication can be given to reduce the chance of filter clotting (e.g. heparin, regional citrate anticoagulation). However, this may not be desirable in all patients as it may increase the patientâ€™s overall bleeding tendency. Even if anticoagulation is given, CRRT filters will eventually clot and termination of dialysis before this happens is desirable, as it will minimise blood loss to the circuit. 

Hence, the aim of this team is to predict the risk of the CRRT filter clotting for patients on CRRT.
